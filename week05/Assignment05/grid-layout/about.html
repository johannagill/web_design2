            <div class="box2 b">Veganism is defined as a way of living that attempts to exclude all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty, whether for food, clothing or any other purpose.<br><br>

                For these reasons, the vegan diet is devoid of all animal products, including meat, eggs and dairy.<br><br>
                
                People choose to follow a vegan diet for various reasons.<br><br>
                
                These usually range from ethics to environmental concerns, but they can also stem from a desire to improve health.<br><br>

                There are different varieties of vegan diets. The most common include: <br><br>

Whole-food vegan diet: A diet based on a wide variety of whole plant foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds.<br><br>

Raw-food vegan diet: A vegan diet based on raw fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds or plant foods cooked at temperatures below 118°F (48°C) (1Trusted Source).
<br><br>
80/10/10: The 80/10/10 diet is a raw-food vegan diet that limits fat-rich plants such as nuts and avocados and relies mainly on raw fruits and soft greens instead. Also referred to as the low-fat, raw-food vegan diet or fruitarian diet.
<br><br>

The starch solution: A low-fat, high-carb vegan diet similar to the 80/10/10 but that focuses on cooked starches like potatoes, rice and corn instead of fruit. <br><br>

Raw till 4: A low-fat vegan diet inspired by the 80/10/10 and starch solution. Raw foods are consumed until 4 p.m., with the option of a cooked plant-based meal for dinner.<br><br>
