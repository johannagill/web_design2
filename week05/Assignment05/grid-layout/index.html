                Veganism is defined as a way of living that attempts to exclude all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty, whether for food, clothing or any other purpose. <br><br>

                For these reasons, the vegan diet is devoid of all animal products, including meat, eggs and dairy.<br><br>
                
                People choose to follow a vegan diet for various reasons.<br><br>
                
                These usually range from ethics to environmental concerns, but they can also stem from a desire to improve health.</div>
