            <div class="box3 sidebar2">A vegan diet may help keep your heart healthy.<br><br>

                Observational studies report vegans may have up to a 75% lower risk of developing high blood pressure and 42% lower risk of dying from heart disease (16Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source). <br><br>
                
                Randomized controlled studies — the gold standard in research — add to the evidence.<br><br>
                
                Several report that vegan diets are much more effective at reducing blood sugar, LDL and total cholesterol than diets they are compared to (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).<br><br>
                
                These effects could be especially beneficial since reducing blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar may reduce heart disease risk by up to 46% (22Trusted Source).</div>
            <div class="box3 content">
                Adopting a vegan diet may help keep your blood sugar in check and type 2 diabetes at bay.<br><br>

                Several studies show that vegans benefit from lower blood sugar levels, higher insulin sensitivity and up to a 78% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than non-vegans (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source).<br><br>
                
                In addition, vegan diets reportedly lower blood sugar levels in diabetics up to 2.4 times more than diets recommended by the ADA, AHA and NCEP (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).<br><br>
                
                Part of the advantage could be explained by the higher fiber intake, which may blunt the blood sugar response. A vegan diet’s weight loss effects may further contribute to its ability to lower blood sugar levels (4Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).</div>
