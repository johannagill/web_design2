        <h3 class="aboutH">Mission</h1>
        <p id="aboutP">The mission of SPCA de PV is to help fund and promote sterilization, adoption and healthcare efforts for companion animals in the Puerto Vallarta area, with the goal of eliminating the euthanasia of healthy and adoptable animals. Monies raised will support these various goals in ways that are most feasible within the community.<br><br>Homeless, neglected and/or abused dogs and cats in the Puerto Vallarta area are rescued by staff and volunteers and brought to our no-kill sanctuary.  Photos and rescue details are posted for each animal on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/spcapv/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums<br><br>Dogs are placed in the intake area upon arrival.  Dogs are bathed, treated for internal/external parasites (fleas, ticks and worms) and tested for diseases.  Each dog is immediately tested for parvovirus and distemper.  A SNAP test is performed to screen for heartworm disease, ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease, both tick borne infections.</p>

        <h3 class="aboutH">General Information</h1>
        <p id="aboutP">SPCA de PV or Sociedad Protectora y Compasiva por los Animales de Puerto Vallarta (Protective and Compassionate Society for the Animals of Puerto Vallarta) was founded in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco Mexico, in 2007 by a long term resident originally from California, Janice Chatterton. <br> <br>

            We opened our unique sanctuary in January of 2012 on the outskirts of Puerto Vallarta.  We are a no-kill shelter and can house up to 130 animals at once.  We rescue and find permanent homes for over 200 animals each year. <br><br>
            
            Our main focus is to rescue the abused, homeless animals from Puerto Vallarta’s streets and place them in foster homes in both the United States and Canada until permanent homes are available.  
            We are not supported by the government, corporations, foundations or businesses. We fully function on private donations.  Animals are often found living on the streets after being discarded and/or extremely abused.  
            We devote ourselves to their physical and emotional rehabilitation and invite everyone to come and interact with the animals at our private shelter on our weekly escorted tours.<br><br>
