            Thank you for opting to ADOPT! Once you find the right animal for your family and that animal arrives to your loving home, you now form part of OUR FAMILY!

Interested in adopting one of our Furry Friends? Our adoption process can be lengthy as many of our animals come from severe situations of abuse and or abandonment and require a healing process that might take some time. Sometimes there might be a waiting list for a particular animal and we always match our animals with the best situation possible.
        </p>
<h3>Adoption Fees</h3>
        <p class="adoptp">

            Mexico: $3,000 pesos<br><br>
            
            US and Canada: $380 USD <br><br>
            
            Note* Adoption fees may change without prior notice.<br><br>
            
            <h3>To Begin the Process</h3>
            
            Now that you have determined the specific animal you wish to adopt, you need to contact us to begin the adoption process.  The process requires you complete a thorough application and return it to us at spcapv@gmail.com.  See below. <br><br>
            
            Once your application has been reviewed, we will be in contact.  Please allow us a few days of review before expecting to hear from us.  Be aware that there may be additional contact required, such as a home visit before the adoption is approved.  Please understand that we want to make sure this is a perfect fit for you as well as our rescue.<br><br>
            
            We will guide you through the transport process if necessary and provide you with all the necessary veterinary records regarding vaccinations, etc.<br><br>
            
            You will also need to agree to the terms of our ADOPTION CONTRACT.   Important to note that if any of the terms of the contract are not honored it will be considered a breach of contract, invalidating it and allowing for retrieval of the animal back to the SPCA PV.<br><br>
